### More scenario
## Mealy Machine - Acceptance scenario:
## State machine with an error state, to which three transitions can lead.
## The first transition has actions that switch LED1 on and LED2 off.
## The second transition switches LED1 off and LED2 on while the third transition switches both led on.

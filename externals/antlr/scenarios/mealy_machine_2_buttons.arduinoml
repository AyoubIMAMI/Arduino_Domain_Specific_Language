### Extension scenario
## Mealy Machine - Acceptance scenario:
## State machine with an error state, to which two transitions can lead.
## The first transition has actions that switch LED1 on and LED2 off.
## The second transition switches LED1 off and LED2 on.

application mealyMachineTwoButtons

# Declaring bricks
sensor buttonOne: 8
sensor buttonTwo: 9
actuator ledOne: 11
actuator ledTwo: 12

# Declaring states

error {

}

-> on {
    ledOne <= LOW
    ledTwo <= LOW

    buttonOne is HIGH (ledOne <= HIGH) => error
    buttonTwo is HIGH (ledTwo <= HIGH) => error
}

## Very simple alarm: Pushing a button activates a LED and a buzzer. Releasing the button switches the actuators off.

# Declaring bricks
sensor buttonOne: 8
sensor buttonTwo: 9
actuator buzzer: 11

# Declaring states
on {
    buzzer <= HIGH
    buttonOne is LOW OR buttonTwo is LOW => off
}

-> off {
    buzzer <= LOW
    buttonOne is HIGH AND buttonTwo is HIGH => on
}

### Basic scenario
## Multi-state alarm: Pushing the button starts the buzz noise.
## Pushing it again stop the buzzer and switch the LED on.
## Pushing it again switch the LED off, and makes the system ready to make noise again after one push, and so on.

application multiStateAlarm

sensor button: 9
actuator led: 12
actuator buzzer: 11

on {
    buzzer <= HIGH
    button is HIGH => step
}

step {
    buzzer <= LOW
    led <= HIGH
    button is HIGH => off
}

-> off {
    led <= LOW
    button is HIGH => on
}
